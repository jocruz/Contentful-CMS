# Contentful CMS Project Overview

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates a dynamic web application powered by Contentful CMS, showcasing a portfolio of projects. Users can view various projects managed through Contentful, providing a streamlined way to update content without code changes.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Utilizes Contentful CMS to manage and display project information dynamically.
- **React-based UI**: Offers a responsive and interactive user experience.
- **Modern Design**: Implements a clean and minimalist design to focus on project showcases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Contentful CMS**: As the backend to manage project data.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx`: The main React component that renders the `Hero` and `Projects` components.
- `src/Hero.jsx`: Displays the hero section with a welcome message and image.
- `src/Projects.jsx`: Fetches and displays projects from Contentful.
- `src/fetchProjects.jsx`: Custom hook to fetch project data from Contentful.
- `src/main.jsx`: Entry point for the React application, rendering the `App` component.
- `src/index.css`: Contains global and component-specific styles.

## How It Works

1. **Hero Section (`Hero.jsx`)**: Introduces the site with a captivating hero image and a brief description.
2. **Fetching Data (`fetchProjects.jsx`)**: Uses a custom React hook to fetch project data from Contentful, leveraging the Contentful Delivery API.
3. **Project Display (`Projects.jsx`)**: Lists the projects fetched from Contentful, displaying titles, images, and links to each project.
4. **Styling (`index.css`)**: Applies CSS for consistent styling and layout across the application.
